There are many great qualities in so called "average" people; the ones that don't stack up to social standards; the ones that don't sparkle; the beige.

In many of them, their decency is so ingrained that no one sees it in them and they don't see in themselves. 

Real goodness is something that has become part of your DNA. It becomes so innate that, sometimes, you fail to realize its existence.

That is why I admire the average person. The man that people don't take into consideration because he isn't impressionable, shiny, or attractive. I look at these people sometimes and admire them and the 
silent world they live in.
